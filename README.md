# CPO_lab4
Implement of Computational Process Management For CPO_lab4

Group Name:224yyds

Laboratory Work Number: 3

Variant Number: 5

Description:
Implement a library for programming in the style ( implement all processes as finite state machines in one global infinite loop with concurrency.) by using decorators to specify state machine handlers where all oilerplate code with working with the state was hidden from a programmer. 

Decorators should support:
call the function after a specific delay (like machine 1 in the manual coded example)

simple sequence of states (like machine 2 in the manual coded example)    

conduction state transition between, based on a return value

work with IO (socket or standard input)

work with queue.
